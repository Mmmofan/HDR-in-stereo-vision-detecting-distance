# HDR-in-stereo-vision-detecting-distance
Windows10+OpenCV3.4.0+VS2017

Based on mixr26's code but no vision part

This is for calibrate the stereo cameras and process high dynamic range photoes

It can help people to get more details or informations when the background dynamic is too big

Feature detecting is on another file(written by python)

Self use, not recommended
